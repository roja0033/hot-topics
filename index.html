                <p>The concept behind money dates back to the beginning of civilization. It's no surprise why money caught on amongst civilized people: It was a much more efficient and convenient way to transact business as opposed to bartering with other goods and services. Can you image keeping all of your wealth in something like livestock?
                    But unlike goods and services, money does not hold an intrinsic value in and of itself. In fact, today, money is merely a piece of specialized paper or numbers on a ledger. While it's important to note that this was not always the case (for much of history, money was minted in coins of metals that held real value), today the system relies on a mutual set of beliefs.
                    That is to say, that money has value because we as a society have assigned it value. In that sense, you can consider money a good with a limited supply and a demand simply because we want more of it. Simply put, we want money because we know that other people want money, so we can trade money for goods and services.
                    This system works because a majority of us, if not all of us, believe in the future value of this money.                    
                     So if we are already in the future where the value of money is simply the value assigned to it, what has stopped us from moving toward an entirely digital currency? The answer is in large part due to our national governments.
                    We have seen the rise (and falls) of digital or cryptographic currencies like Bitcoin. 
                    Some continue to wonder what we're all still doing with the dollar (or the pound, euro, yen, etc.). But beyond the issues of storage of value with these digital currencies, it is difficult to imagine a world in which such currencies replace the national currencies like the dollar. 
                    In fact, as long as governments continue to collect a tax, they will have the authority to dictate the currency in which those taxes may be paid.

                <p> Technology has the power to do many things, and changing the world is one of them.
                    We're privileged to be living in a time where science and technology can assist us, make our lives easier and rethink the ways we go about our daily lives.
                    The technology we're already exposed and accustomed to has paved the way for us to innovate further, and this list of current and future technologies certainly have the potential to change our lives even more
                    Here's the list of technologies that will "probably" change our lives forever over the coming decade and beyond:
                    <br><br> <strong>Space Tourism</strong> <br><br>
                    We can fly to virtually any country in the world without any trouble, but what if we could all one day see the earth from space?
                    Companies such as Virgin Galactic, SpaceX and even Amazon's Blue Origin, want to make it a reality one day, and give us a (very expensive) seat aboard a spaceship to take us into orbit. 
                    Passengers on Amazon's New Shepard space shuttle will be taken 100km above sea level, before parachuting back to earth.
                    <br><br> <strong>Colonisation of other planets</strong> <br><br>
                    We've been wreaking havoc on Earth for a long time and the planet can only put up with mankind's destructive nature for so long.
                    If we don't destroy it, we'll one day outgrow it. Plans are in the works to colonise other planets and Mars will no doubt be the first port of call.
                    With leaps forward in technology, this vision of the future is quickly becoming science-fact, rather than science-fiction.

                <p>A GMO, or genetically modified organism, is a plant, animal, microorganism or other organism whose genetic makeup has been modified in a laboratory using genetic engineering or transgenic technology.
                    This creates combinations of plant, animal, bacterial and virus genes that do not occur in nature or through traditional crossbreeding methods.
                    Most GMOs have been engineered to withstand the direct application of herbicide and/or to produce an insecticide.
                    However, new technologies are now being used to artificially develop other traits in plants, such as a resistance to browning in apples, and to create new organisms using synthetic biology.
                    Despite biotech industry promises, there is no evidence that any of the GMOs currently on the market offer increased yield, drought tolerance, enhanced nutrition, or any other consumer benefit.
                    <br><br> <strong>What are the impacts of GMOs on the environment?</strong> <br><br>
                    More than 80% of all genetically modified crops grown worldwide have been engineered for herbicide tolerance.2 As a result, the use of toxic herbicides, such as Roundup®, has increased fifteenfold since GMOs were first introduced.3 In March 2015, the World Health Organization determined that the herbicide glyphosate (the key ingredient in Roundup®) is “probably carcinogenic to humans.”
                    Genetically modified crops also are responsible for the emergence of “superweeds” and “superbugs,” which can only be killed with ever more toxic poisons such as 2,4-D (a major ingredient in Agent Orange).
                    Most GMOs are a direct extension of chemical agriculture and are developed and sold by the world’s largest chemical companies. The longterm impacts of these GMOs are unknown. Once released into the environment, these novel organisms cannot be recalled.
